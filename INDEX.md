# Avatar Animation Update

## Changes Made
- I have updated the `complete_usl_system.html` file to include animations for all the questions in the screening ontology.
- Previously, the avatar would only animate for a subset of the questions. Now, it will perform a unique animation for each question.

## How to Test
1. Open the `complete_usl_system.html` file in a web browser.
2. The screening will start automatically.
3. As each question is displayed, observe the avatar on the right side of the screen.
4. The avatar should perform a series of gestures that correspond to the question being asked.
5. This should happen for all questions in the screening process.
